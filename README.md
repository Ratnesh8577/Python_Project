# Insurance Premium Prediction System

# Objective
This project provides a machine-learning powered system built using Python, where the backend is developed with FastAPI to deliver real-time 
insurance premium predictions through API endpoints, and the frontend can send user inputs such as age, BMI, sex, smoking status, region, 
and number of dependents; the backend processes this data using a trained ML model and returns accurate premium predictions efficiently to the 
frontend for display.
